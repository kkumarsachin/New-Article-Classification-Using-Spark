This is a landmark motion picture — a movie about people living with autism in which all of the characters who have autism are portrayed by nonprofessional performers who also have it. The problem with thirtysomething David (Brandon Polansky) is that he doesn’t think he has a condition of any kind. His occasional anxious fits of wheezing he puts down to allergies, and he’s not at all self-conscious about the staggeringly offensive jokes he tells at the wrong time to the wrong people. A pig joke told to a cop has gotten him arrested and sentenced to spend time with a support group of other people with autism. He’s at first completely contemptuous.He’s particularly annoyed by Sarah (Samantha Elisofon), with whom he is given a homework assignment that obliges them to visit the Brooklyn Bridge together. Sarah has a winning and nearly constant smile and a startling openness. The film, written and directed by Rachel Israel, respects these characters by portraying their whole, unfiltered selves.

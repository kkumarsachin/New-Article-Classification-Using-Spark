If, like me, you’ve been imbibing rather more than usual this last year, then you won’t need much persuading to watch “Our Blood Is Wine,” a slightly tipsy, thoroughly charming documentary about winemaking in post-Soviet Georgia. By the end, so many glasses have been raised in lip-smacking appreciation that the movie’s most impressive accomplishment is not its deep dive into grape-centered lore, but the ability of its director, Emily Railsback, to hold her iPhone camera steady.Eagerly accompanied by the sommelier Jeremy Quinn, Ms. Railsback scours the country to discover a reinvigorated culture of independent vintners and ancient traditions. The homogenized factory wine produced under the Soviets — pronounced “garbage” by one Georgian and necessitating the destruction of hundreds of varieties of grapes — is a stain that these dedicated craftsmen are eager to erase. Employing an underground fermenting method many thousands of years old, they bury the grape slurry in handmade clay pots. Nine months later, a delicious drink is born, its initial tasting typically described as a sacred experience. An ecstatic Mr. Quinn concurs.

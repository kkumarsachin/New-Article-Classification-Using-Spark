“The Leisure Seeker,” the first English-language feature from the Italian director Paolo Virzì, stars Helen Mirren and Donald Sutherland as a couple who skip town in a 1975 Winnebago, heading from Wellesley, Mass., to Florida, without giving notice to anyone, including their grown children. Ella (Ms. Mirren) plans to take John (Mr. Sutherland), an expert on Ernest Hemingway, to the Hemingway Home in Key West.John has symptoms consistent with Alzheimer’s disease, although that term is never used. And Ella, nursing her pain with a steady stream of whiskey, is clearly dying; the diagnosis will be obvious to viewers long before the film reveals it. “The Leisure Seeker” becomes a defense of their right to live their last days as they see fit — on the road instead of in nursing homes or hospitals.The sentiment is admirable; the execution decidedly is not. Part of the problem is that the screenwriters (four, including Mr. Virzì, share credit, working from a novel by Michael Zadoorian) treat the characters’ symptoms as plot devices — traits they can ignore or play up as each scene demands. (Some other Alzheimer’s films, like “Away From Her,” have done a better job of avoiding this trap.) When it’s time for a twist, John’s mind happens to be in the right year and place to share a secret.Neither ailment interferes with a host of cloying incidents, as when John drives off without Ella, forcing her to take a ride on a motorcycle to catch up. Or when the two experience a flat tire and are held up by a pair of young men. (Ella retrieves the shotgun she’s brought along, scaring them off, and John, who has already scolded one for ending a sentence with a preposition, tells them it’s not too late to take evening classes and turn their lives around.) In a mortifying sprinkling of topicality, the movie — set in summer 2016 — shows John, a lifelong Democratic voter, unwittingly joining in the chants at a rally for Donald Trump.

Magical, subtle, sensitive and touching, “I Kill Giants” is everything the bombastic “A Wrinkle in Time” is not. Written by Joe Kelly (based on his graphic novel with J.M. Ken Niimura), this intimate story about a troubled 12-year-old who’s on a mission to save her town is virtually tone perfect.That’s not easy in a feature (the first from the Danish director Anders Walter, returning to ideas he explored in his 2013 Oscar-winning short film, “Helium”) that treads a fragile path between adult themes and childlike wonder. Their point of intersection is Barbara (Madison Wolfe), a driven loner who wears bunny ears — a nod to her spirit animal — and believes that giants are threatening her small coastal community. When we meet her, she’s setting ingeniously intricate traps with a jam-like bait containing glitter and gummy bears. Later, she checks the protective amulets she’s scattered around her school, brushing off a bully with sharp-witted confidence. She’s not afraid: she’s the dragon slayer.Thinly plotted but beautifully executed, “I Kill Giants” clings fiercely to Barbara’s fantastical quest, only tentatively allowing those closest to her — a worried school counselor (Zoe Saldana), a curious new girl (Sydney Wade) and Barbara’s exhausted older sister (a fine Imogen Poots) — to shed light on its source. Capturing beach and woodland in wide, scenic sweeps, the director of photography, Rasmus Heise, balances the film’s thick and volatile emotions with a welcome airiness. Outside, stalking monsters, is where Barbara lives and breathes.Pondering grief and denial, lost dreams and irrevocably altered futures, Mr. Walter proves you don’t need a giant-sized special-effects budget to conjure enchantment and danger.

GLENDALE, Ariz. — A few years ago, it was every team’s fantasy: 1,000 innings from five starters. Chances are it would never work out like that, but with good health and a little more than six innings per start, it was possible.Now, that concept is as dead as the paper All-Star ballot. Last season, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ rotation averaged just 86 pitches per start, the fewest in the majors. Yet they won the most games, 104, and their starters’ 3.39 E.R.A. was the best in baseball. Less was more.

Jimmy Kimmel once again brought his dry, sardonic style to his role as host of the Oscars. His monologue, preceded by a black-and-white video send-up of some A-list stars, was filled with barbs against Harvey Weinstein, Mel Gibson and others. He also threw jibes at President Trump, and poked fun at last year’s Oscar envelope mix-up.Some of his commentary needed to be taken with a grain of salt. At one point, Mr. Kimmel said, “Of the nine best picture nominees, only two of them made more than $100 million.” That may have been true domestically, but most of the films hit that total if foreign ticket sales were factored in.

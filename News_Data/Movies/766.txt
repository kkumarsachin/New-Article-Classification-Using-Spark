It turns out the 14th time is the charm.After repeatedly being nominated for an Oscar for an expansive catalog of cinematography that includes films like Martin Scorsese’s “Kundun” and Frank Darabont’s “The Shawshank Redemption,” Roger Deakins finally won his first statue. His work on the sequel “Blade Runner 2049” was what finally did the trick for a career dating back to the 1970s.Mr. Deakins was lighthearted and reserved in his acceptance speech, joking that he had “better say something or else they’ll give me a jet ski,” referring to the host Jimmy Kimmel’s prize for  the  shortest speech of the night.

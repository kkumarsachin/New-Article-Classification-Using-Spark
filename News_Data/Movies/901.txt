Too leaden for farce and too bland for satire, Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse’s “Dear Dictator” wastes a potential gold mine of culture-clashing silliness on worn, high school movie clichés.Paralleling two revolutions — one social, the other political — the story makes unlikely allies of Tatiana (Odeya Rush), a misfit American teenager, and Gen. Anton Vincent (Michael Caine), a newly ousted Caribbean despot. Initially pen pals as a result of an innocent social-studies assignment, the two become unexpected roommates when a coup sends Anton fleeing to the suburban home where Tatiana lives with her vacuous single mother, Darlene (Katie Holmes). I wish I could say that wackiness ensues.Settling in the garage, Anton busies himself making propaganda videos and tidying the garden. Between lectures on the evils of capitalism, he advises Tatiana on how best to overthrow her school’s slutty queen bees. Darlene, for her part, is too impressed by their guest’s plumbing skills and perfect mole to wonder if he’s dangerous. Anyway, having your toes sucked daily by your married boss (a greasy Seth Green) leaves little time to fear for your life.

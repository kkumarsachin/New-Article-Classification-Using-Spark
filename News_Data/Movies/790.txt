“Mary Poppins Returns” isn’t Disney’s only forthcoming reboot of a beloved British period piece. The studio just released the first teaser for “Christopher Robin,” a hybrid of live action and animation that finds the grown-up title character (Ewan McGregor) getting a visit from his old stuffed pal, Winnie the Pooh.The huggable bear is voiced by Jim Cummings, replacing Sterling Holloway (who died in 1992) for a second time. Mr. Cummings also took over as Kaa the Snake in “The Jungle Book 2” in 2003.Pooh shows up to help out Christopher when he’s struggling to balance the demands of his job with his commitment to his wife (Hayley Atwell) and daughter (Bronte Carmichael).Other characters from the Hundred Acre Wood who are expected to appear in the film but are neither seen nor heard in the trailer include Tigger (Chris O’Dowd), Owl (Toby Jones), Kanga (Sophie Okonedo), Piglet (Nick Mohammed) and Eeyore (Brad Garrett). The movie is directed by Marc Forster, who brought a new take to the Peter Pan tale with “Finding Neverland” in 2004.

Fresh off the dissolution of her marriage and the death of her mother, a woman at the end of her wits leaves London for Los Angeles to find the father who abandoned her as a toddler. “No Light and No Land Anywhere” is a character study of a foreigner seeking connections in a city of strangers. By day, the woman, Lexi (Gemma Brockis), searches for a way to contact her father and the second family he made in America. By night, she allows herself to remain anonymous, meeting strangers in bars and on the street, experimenting with closeness without risking intimacy.The film’s writer and director, Amber Sealey, hews close to Lexi, but the camera rarely takes up Lexi’s perspective, preferring to observe her behavior rather than trying to see through her eyes. A result of this visual flatness is that some sequences drag with clichés, as the camera dithers on hackneyed images like Lexi flushing her wedding ring down the motel sink.

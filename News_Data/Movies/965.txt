“Summer in the Forest” is an extraordinarily tender documentary that asks what it means to be human. Here, even the most gentle scenes raise mighty questions.In the 1960s, Jean Vanier founded L’Arche, a community near Paris that has become home to many men and women with developmental disabilities. The filmmakers follow Mr. Vanier, now in his 80s, as he lives and works with those who have Down syndrome and other conditions.Though Mr. Vanier provides some background in his comforting voice-over, we mostly survey L’Arche residents as they go about their lives. Decades ago, it was a radical experiment to remove those with disabilities from institutions. But by doing so, Mr. Vanier says, they have greater freedom and can prompt those without disabilities to redefine what is considered “normal” and “happy.”He’s right. Just watching the residents leads you to confront and change many of your own preconceptions. Still, Randall Wright, the director, can be too content to only observe. The group now operates in dozens of countries, and details on its services and funding are scarce. (Viewers seeking information on L’Arche can find it in several books, including Ian Brown’s profoundly moving “The Boy in the Moon.”)

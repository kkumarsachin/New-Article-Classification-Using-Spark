“Thoroughbreds” opens on an ominous, murkily lit scene — a girl, a horse and a worryingly sharp knife — that telegraphs just how ugly things are going to get in this movie. You learn in short order that the horse is a goner, and it isn’t long into this slick, shallow movie that you wish the girl, Amanda (Olivia Cooke), was, too. This is no fault of Ms. Cooke, an appealing performer (she was the girl in “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl”). She and her equally likable co-star, Anya Taylor-Joy (“The Witch”), have been burdened with giving their matching ciphers flesh and a reason for us to watch.Ms. Taylor-Joy plays Lily, a wealthy teenager who is tutoring Amanda when the story begins. Amanda, who’s more middle-class comfortable, knows that Lily is getting paid for her attention, which doesn’t stop the girls from curiously circling each other. They were once friends and soon ease into a new, unpersuasive intimacy (they watch Shirley Temple on TV), largely so the writer-director Cory Finley can make them combust. What happens next is pretty much what you would expect from peewee nihilists (“Heathers”) adrift in a bourgeois hellscape of quiet dinners and symmetrical visuals (“American Beauty”).Making his feature directing debut, Mr. Finley gives the movie a professional sheen and gets fine performances from his actors, including Anton Yelchin as a sad sack with a bull’s-eye where his brains should be, and Paul Sparks as Lily’s chilled-to-the-bone stepfather. Nothing these two characters do or say is surprising. Yet both actors give their roles a spark of life — Mr. Yelchin lends the movie heart in one of his final performances, Mr. Sparks gives it a touch of realistic cunning — that let you see where this movie might have gone if Mr. Finley hadn’t relied on formula.

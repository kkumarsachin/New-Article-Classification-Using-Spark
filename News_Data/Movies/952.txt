The Jason Bateman-Rachel McAdams comedy “Game Night” has recently scored a win at the box office, earning more than $85 million worldwide so far, and now the trailer has been released for another starry, game-based farce: “Tag.”Yes, it’s inspired by the childhood chase, but in this case, it’s based on the true story of a group of friends who continued the game for decades into adulthood. The cast includes Jeremy Renner (who’s not known for comedy, especially after his appearance in the Will Ferrell-Amy Poehler flop “The House”), Ed Helms, Jon Hamm, Hannibal Buress, Isla Fisher, Rashida Jones and Leslie Bibb.Through childbirth, a wedding and a funeral, the game continues, and the trailer makes humorous use of MC Hammer’s 1990 chestnut “U Can’t Touch This” to score its scenes of slapstick mayhem. One bit, in which Mr. Hamm clocks Mr. Helms across the face, might remind viewers of the “slap bet” gags from TV’s “How I Met Your Mother.”

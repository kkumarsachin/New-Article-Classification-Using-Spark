“Flower,” like its pushy 17-year-old heroine, Erica (Zoey Deutch), has a dirty mouth and a strutting confidence. Our introduction to both takes place in the front seat of a police car, where Erica is enthusiastically pleasuring the uniformed driver before extorting cash for her silence. Then it’s off to the Dairy Queen with her two sidekicks to crow over a caper she’s enacted several times before.Cruelly amoral and only marginally credible, “Flower” is nevertheless wildly entertaining and at times even touching. Antic and impulsive, Erica is a smart, damaged bully whose father is in prison and whose mother, Laurie (the great Kathryn Hahn), would rather befriend than parent. The teenager also has a strange fixation on penises, which she gratifies by having close encounters with as many as possible and sketching them in a notebook. It’s all very cute, until Laurie’s boyfriend and his deeply troubled son (Tim Heidecker and Joey Morgan) move in and the narrative dives off a cliff.Even so, the fall is propelled by such zippy dialogue and unexpectedly sweet moments (Erica and Laurie’s relationship, especially, is warmly believable) that you may not care. The supporting players — including Adam Scott as a possibly skeevy high school teacher — are all strong, and the director, Max Winkler (son of Henry), never breaks stride. Making liberal use of dizzying close-ups, he swerves from dark coming-of-age comedy to outright horror, refusing to punish Erica for behavior that grows ever more appalling.

Dr. Seuss’ classic children’s book “How the Grinch Stole Christmas!” was first adapted as an animated TV special in 1966, with Boris Karloff voicing the titular grump. Then Jim Carrey embodied the curmudgeon in a live-action 2000 version. Now Benedict Cumberbatch is bringing his own take to the crotchety, holiday-hating character in a big-screen cartoon simply titled “Dr. Seuss’ the Grinch,” which has just released its first trailer.The film was made by Illumination, the same company behind “The Secret Life of Pets,” “Sing” and the “Despicable Me” franchise. The new teaser includes a sly inside joke, as the Grinch is woken up — and annoyed — when his alarm clock plays Pharrell Williams’s relentlessly upbeat song “Happy,” the Oscar-nominated tune from “Despicable Me 2.”Most of the clip’s footage features the Grinch and his loyal dog, Max, who fixes his boss a hot beverage with a frowny face floating on the surface. For his part, the mean green one shuts down someone trying to wish him “Happy holidays” at the grocery store and vomits into a jar after tasting pickles — then puts it back on the shelf.

Since early in his career, the South Korean director Hong Sang-soo has told stories about the frustrated and frustrating love lives of movie people. They’re mostly male, mostly screenwriters or directors, and they’re mostly very heavy drinkers. Although they’re more confused than is considered healthy even when they’re sober. One thing about these characters is that you’d never know they worked in movies if they didn’t mention it in the dialogue. Mr. Hong’s camera almost never depicts movie sets.So it stands to reason, then, that although “Claire’s Camera,” the latest of Mr. Hong’s films to open in New York, was shot in Cannes, a little beach town on the French Riviera known for hosting perhaps the most famous film festival in the world, there’s nary a glimpse of ritz and glamour to be seen. Yes, the movie opens in a makeshift Korean film sales office, and on one of its doors hangs a poster for Mr. Hong’s 2016 movie, “Yourself and Yours.” But there’s no red carpet, no paparazzi, and the beach the characters visit seems far from the cinema palaces of Cannes.The relatively plain settings allow the filmmaker to do what he does best: focus on his characters, whose befuddlement is sometimes funny and sometimes troubling. In a maddeningly elliptical conversation at a café table outside, a young assistant, Man-hee (Kim Min-hee, of the 2016 film “The Handmaiden”), is fired by her boss, Yang-hye (Chang Mi-hee). As it happens, Man-hee had a one-night stand with the director So Wan-soo (Jung Jin-young), who is officially dating Yang-hye, albeit perhaps on the sly. “Ninety-five percent of the mistakes” in his life, he muses, have been because of drinking.

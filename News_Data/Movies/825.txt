The director Roland Joffé (who made “The Killing Fields,” about Pol Pot’s slaughter in Cambodia, and “The Mission,” a tale of 18th-century colonialism with pronounced allegorical accents) is not known for a light touch. Here, adapting a play by Michael Ashton, he makes South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission of the 1990s his subject, and “The Forgiven” is heavy-handed from its early texts explaining apartheid through its end credits.Mr. Ashton’s scenario, on which Mr. Joffé collaborated for the screenplay, pits the real-life figure Archbishop Desmond Tutu (Forest Whitaker) against a fictional composite, Piet Blomfeld (Eric Bana), an unrepentant one-time death squad member and now a prison lifer. Blomfeld taunts Tutu, quoting Milton at him (the “Better to reign in hell” line, what else), while the archbishop holds that “no one is beyond redemption.” As it happens, Blomfeld holds the key to an atrocity mystery that the commission is investigating.

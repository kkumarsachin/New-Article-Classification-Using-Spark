As recovery culture has seeped into the mainstream, the axiom “hurt people hurt people” is morphing from truism to cliché. “Allure,” a new film from Canada written and directed by the brothers Carlos and Jason Sanchez, introduces its lead character, Laura, as a damaged person, and then sometimes teases the viewer about how she got that way.The movie is pretty direct, though, about the damage she can do in turn. Laura, played by Evan Rachel Wood with her usual commendable concentration and attention to detail, works for a home-cleaning company run by her father (Denis O’Hare). In one of the houses she looks after there’s a delicate 16-year-old girl, Eva (Julia Sarah Stone), who’s locked in a battle with her mother. The two form a tentative friendship over music and weed, and soon Laura has Eva at her home, and very much wants her to stay — to the extent that she forces the issue, to say the least, first through wheedling, then through locked doors.After Laura convinces the police that she had nothing to do with Eva’s disappearance, the film becomes a character study of one lost soul trying to engulf another. Laura’s behavior once Eva settles in is discomfiting. She acts as both a gentle lover and an egocentric, vengeful parent figure. In a number of scenes, the characters are framed in doorways and hallways, the camera maintaining a distance that I suppose it wishes the viewer to take as discreet. I saw the strategy as more to do with withholding, and I think it backfires.

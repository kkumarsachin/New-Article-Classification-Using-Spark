It’s never a good sign when a movie racks up its first ironic music cue before there is anything to be ironic about. “The Strangers: Prey at Night” opens with the ’80s rock classic “Kids in America” by Kim Wilde, I guess because some of the masked rampaging killers in this movie are youngish, and are in America.This is a follow-up to “The Strangers,” an exercise in sadism from 2008 that got some respect from folks who, I believe, were yearning a little too hard for a subtext feast along the lines of “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.”“Prey at Night” follows an unhappy family — Christina Hendricks as mom, Martin Henderson as dad, Bailee Madison and Lewis Pullman as their discontented teens — to a trailer park for an overnight stay that turns into slaughter. There’s a lot of low-lying fog before the masked killers come a-calling, and a lot of arterial stab wounds after they show up.The film, directed by Johannes Roberts, shamelessly lifts from several better horror movies. To give you an idea of how low I’m setting the bar in terms of “better,” one scene simultaneously cribs from the no-budget Southern cult film “The Mutilator” (1984) and the ultra-gory and occasionally goofy Italian shocker “Zombie” (1979).

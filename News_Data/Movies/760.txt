With new practices in place, it would be hard for the Oscars to repeat last year’s best picture mix-up.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences confirmed several changes in January, including presenters ensuring they have the correct envelope before they go on stage, with that fact confirmed by stage managers, too. PwC accountants were forbidden from using social media during the show, in hopes of reducing distractions.But the biggest change became quickly apparent on Sunday as Viola Davis presented the award for best supporting actor. The gold, giant bold type on the dark envelope, loudly announcing the name of the category, was so unmistakable it could be read clearly on TV. Last year’s envelope was an elegant red, but the smaller gold lettering on it was not so easily readable.The changes are intended to avoid an embarrassing mistake akin to the one the academy suffered last year, when a PwC representative mistakenly handed Warren Beatty the backup envelope for best actress, which had already been awarded to Emma Stone for “La La Land.” Mr. Beatty and his co-presenter, Faye Dunaway, were presenting best picture.After Mr. Beatty opened the envelope onstage, he hesitated. Ms. Dunaway read out “La La Land” — but “Moonlight” was the real winner, only to be revealed several moments later when the mistake was acknowledged.Last year’s PwC accountants, Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz, were replaced by Rick Rosas and Kimberly Bourdon. A third PwC accountant will sit in the control room with the producers of the show, the firm said.And all three accountants were scheduled to attend rehearsals and practice any mix-ups if one slips through, the firm said.

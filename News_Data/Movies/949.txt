“In 2018, women are killing it.” That’s the opening line of the trailer for the new Mila Kunis-Kate McKinnon comedy “The Spy Who Dumped Me.” While that invokes the spirit of the current feminist moment, what follows seems to play into stereotypes from an earlier time, like the one about women being bad drivers.When the two are drawn into a world of espionage after the ex-boyfriend (Justin Theroux) of Ms. Kunis’s Audrey is revealed to be a C.I.A. agent, they struggle with a stick shift.In the teaser, which dropped Wednesday, an operative played by the “Outlander” favorite Sam Heughan clues the women into the spy game and they grow more competent in their secret-agenting skills, much like Melissa McCarthy’s desk jockey in the 2015 comedy “Spy.” Yet once they’re subjected to potential torture by an enemy, they become hysterical and start spilling secrets. (“Audrey shaves between her boobs,” Ms. McKinnon says.)Co-written and directed by Susanna Fogel (best known for the short-lived TV drama “Chasing Life”), “The Spy Who Dumped Me” plays off James Bond films, from a title reminiscent of “The Spy Who Loved Me” to the 007-style opening montage and the sexy song in the trailer: a cover of Nina Simone’s “Feeling Good” by Michael Bublé.

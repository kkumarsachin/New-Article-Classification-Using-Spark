The story of “A Bag of Marbles” follows two young Jewish brothers, Joseph (Dorian Le Clech) and Maurice (Batyste Fleurial), who flee Nazi-occupied Paris in 1942, as Hitler moves the policies of his so-called final solution into the city.In Vichy France, the boys find a town by the sea that is almost idyllic; the Italians stationed there are not pursuing Hitler’s goals. But when Italy surrenders to the Allies and Germany takes full control of Vichy, the rounding up of Jews begins there.The boys go on the run once more. The movie takes a terrifying turn when the brothers are taken into Nazi custody, and an obsessive commandant, who wields a cigarette holder as if it’s a mustache he’d like to twirl, is hellbent on getting them to admit they’re Jewish.This film, directed by Christian Duguay, is the second time the French author Joseph Joffo’s 1973 autobiographical novel, “Un Sac de Billes,” has been adapted into a movie. (The first version, directed by Jacques Doillon in 1975, never found a U.S. release.) Mr. Duguay chooses to frame this story in a period mode highly influenced by Hollywood pictures. Despite the hardships endured by the characters, nearly every shot seems dappled with nostalgia. The music score is sentimental, with shimmering pianos and trembling strings.
